## Our Mission

T.S. Eliot once said that &#8216;genuine poetry can communicate before
it is understood&#8217;. At HVTN, we want to publish writing that affects
us before we know why and how it does so, that invites us in and locks
the door, that resists simple classification and easy escape.
We believe in writing that is bigger on the inside,
writing that is greater than the sum of its parts.
